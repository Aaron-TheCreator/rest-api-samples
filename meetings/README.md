# Cisco > Webex > REST API Samples > Meetings

The [Webex Meetings REST API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/meetings) enables seamless integration of Webex Meetings into your websites, apps, and services. Schedule meetings, invite meeting attendees, update preferences, and more.

## CRUD

The acronymn CRUD stands for: (C)reate, (R)ead, (U)pdate, (D)elete, which forms a basic set of essential operations when working with data. In this case, the data pertains to Webex meetings. You may make calls to the Webex API to create meetings, list meetings, make changes to meetings, and cancel meetings. Each operation is demonstrated seperately in sub-folders under this directory.

### CREATE
